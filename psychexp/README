Library for programming psychological experiments

It essentially relies on a SDL2 (see <https://www.libsdl.org>)


# Prerequisites

You need a environment to compile and build C programs (gcc, make, ...): 

    sudo apt install build-essential autotools libtool

You must have the SDL2 library source installed on your system. Under Ubuntu, this means running:

    sudo apt install libsdl2-dev


# Installation

    libtoolize
    autoreconf
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

To use it

1.  Your source code should contain 

        #include <psychexp.h>

2. Compile with `-lSDL2 -lpsychexp`
